# Roboadvisor Mobile App

## :book: Introduction

The fintech industry has been disrupted. Weâ€™re seeing seismic shifts in the ways which people grow their money. Conventional banking and investing methods are now replaced with digital banks and roboadvisors.

However, as a person of faith, I can only invest in shariah-compliant products. Hence, my project is about developing a shariah-compliant roboadvisor app that can serve this demographic, especially in SEA.

## :bowtie: Reflections

React Native was challenging; the learning curve was far steeper than learning PHP (Laravel). There were moments when I was stuck with no end in mind. However, I managed to resolve errors and bugs by making Google my best friend, asking questions in StackOverflow and of course with some help from my trainers. Moving forward, this is an app which I am passionate about and may build on it in the near future.
